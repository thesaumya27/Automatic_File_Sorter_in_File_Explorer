# Automatic_File_Sorter_in_File_Explorer
This Python-based project automates the process of organizing files in a specified directory. The script categorizes files into predefined folders (e.g., PDFs, images, audio, video) based on their extensions. If the required folders do not exist, the program creates them dynamically and moves the corresponding files into their respective folders.

## Key features:

Identifies and organizes files by extensions (e.g., .pdf, .jpg, .mp3, .mp4, .mkv).
Automatically creates folders for each file type.
Prevents duplicate file moves by checking for existing files in the target folders.
